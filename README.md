# Longitudinal.dev

The repo is in an early public state—expect rough edges while the launch is prepared.

Additional helpers live under `scripts/` (see `scripts/README.md` for details on the `build/`, `deploy/`, and `dev/` subfolders).

## Documentation

Lightweight notes live under `docs/`:

- `docs/TESTING.md` – how to run the preflight script (`CHECK_SSG=true ./scripts/dev/check.sh`).
