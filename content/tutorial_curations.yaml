# Tutorial Curations Configuration
#
# This file defines curated tutorial collections for the tutorials landing page.
# Edit this file to update curated sections without code changes.
#
# Slugs must match tutorial markdown filenames (without .md extension).

# Featured: Curated highlights (6-8 tutorials)
featured:
  - lmm-random-intercept      # Foundation concept, simplest mixed model
  - lmm-random-slopes         # Natural next step from random intercept
  - lgcm-basic                # Introduces growth modeling paradigm
  - gee                       # Alternative to mixed models, different assumptions
  - glmm                      # Extends LMM to non-continuous outcomes
  - residualized-change-score # Simple change-score approach
