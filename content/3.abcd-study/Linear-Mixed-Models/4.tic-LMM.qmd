## <span class="text-green-500 text-4xl font-extrabold text-transparent">Introduction</span>

A **linear mixed model (LMM)** with **random intercepts and slopes** extends ordinary linear regression (with fixed effects only) by allowing each participant to have both a unique baseline level (intercept) and a unique rate of change (slope).Additionally, incorporating a time-invariant covariate (TIC) enables us to examine how stable, individual characteristics influence both baseline levels and trajectories of change.

In this example, we analyze cognition scores from participants assessed at four annual time points in the ABCD Study®. We include parental education as a time-invariant covariate to investigate whether it estimates both baseline cognition scores and rates of cognitive change over time.

This approach allows us to estimate the overall effect of time on cognition while accounting for individual variability in both starting scores and cognitive trajectories, as well as how a stable characteristic like parental education influences these patterns. Finally, we visualize the model’s estimations to examine the effects of parental education on cognitive development across time.

        The **fixed effects estimates** indicate that the average cognition score at baseline (time = 0) is `r round(summ$coefficients[[1]],2)` (p < 0.001). Over time, cognition declines by approximately `r round(abs(summ$coefficients[[2]]),2)` points per biannual assessment (p < 0.001), suggesting a **gradual decline** in cognitive performance. Additionally, **higher parental education** levels are associated with significantly higher cognition scores (β = `r round(summ$coefficients[[3]],2)`, p < 0.001), indicating a positive relationship between parental education and cognitive performance.

        Examining the random effects, there is **substantial variability in baseline cognition scores** (random intercept variance τ₀₀ = `r round(summ$varcor[[1]][1],2)`) and individual rates of cognitive decline (random slope variance τ₁₁ = `r round(summ$varcor[[1]][4],3)`). The negative correlation (ρ₀₁ = `r round(as.data.frame(summ$varcor)[3,5],2)`) between the intercept and slope suggests that individuals with higher initial cognition scores tend to experience steeper declines over time.

        The plot illustrates individual and overall cognition trajectories over time. **Red lines represent observed cognition trajectories for each participant**, while **grey lines* depict their model-estimated trajectories incorporating both **random intercepts and random slopes**. The **blue line** represents the overall **fixed-effect mean trajectory**, summarizing the population-average trend in cognition from **Baseline to Year 6**.

        Compared to the **random intercept-only model**, the **random slopes component allows for individual differences in the rate of cognitive change** over time. This results in diverging trajectories, where some individuals experience **steeper declines** while others remain relatively stable. The **negative intercept-slope correlation (-0.28)** suggests that those with higher initial cognition tend to decline faster, a pattern captured by the spread of grey lines becoming wider over time.

## <span class="text-green-500 text-4xl font-extrabold text-transparent">Discussion</span>

- **Parental education** and cognitive trajectories: Participants with higher parental education tended to start with higher baseline cognition scores and showed different rates of change over time.

- **Random intercept and slope variability**: The inclusion of parental education as a time-invariant covariate allowed for better modeling of individual differences in cognitive growth.  

- **Model interpretation**: Higher parental education was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline, suggesting a potential protective effect.  

- **Conclusion**: Incorporating time-invariant covariates into an LMM provides additional insight into how stable individual characteristics influence both initial status and rates of change in longitudinal outcomes.
