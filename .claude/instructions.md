# Project-Specific Instructions

## Response Style
- Be concise and direct while retaining important details
- Avoid excessive formatting (multiple headers, boxes, decorative elements)
- Use bullet points instead of lengthy paragraphs when appropriate
- Limit examples to 1-2 most relevant cases
- Provide summaries upfront, details only when needed
- Skip redundant confirmation statements

## Tutorial Work
- Focus on accuracy over verbosity
- When reviewing: report findings directly without extensive methodology descriptions
- When recommending: state preference clearly with brief justification
- Avoid creating extensive "options matrices" unless specifically requested
